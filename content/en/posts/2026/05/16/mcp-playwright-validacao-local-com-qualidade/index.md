Recurring scenario: you finish a frontend feature, run `git diff`, everything looks fine, you commit. Five minutes later someone opens a PR and says "the button disappeared on mobile." Welcome to the visual regression hole. Question: can you catch this before the PR? Dry answer: yes. And the cheapest path today runs through MCP + Playwright.

**TL;DR:** MCP Playwright is not a new testing framework. It doesn't replace CI/CD. It doesn't replace the E2E suite your engineer wrote. **It's your way of asking Claude to test locally for you** — and hand you screenshots as proof.

The dev flow has always been: code, write unit tests, run the app locally and click through it manually, open the PR. The "run the app and click through it" step was the one that got skipped most. "Unit passed, ship it to CI." Then a bug hits production that CI didn't catch because CI doesn't cover every possible path. With MCP Playwright, that step is no longer yours — it becomes the AI navigating your app, validating the flow, taking a screenshot of each relevant state. You gain time. The PR gains evidence. CI keeps doing its job.

## What MCP is, without the jargon

<dfn>MCP — Model Context Protocol</dfn> is an open protocol created by Anthropic to connect LLMs to external tools. Think of it as USB for AI: one standard, plug in, and any compatible LLM talks to any "MCP server" on the market.

Before MCP, integrating AI with external tools was artisanal. Each client (Claude Code, Cursor, Continue) had its own way of invoking tools. Each tool needed a specific adapter. Chaos.

MCP standardizes that. There are three pieces:

- **Client** — the app where the AI runs (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.)
- **MCP server** — a separate process that exposes tools via protocol. Can run locally, remote, in containers, anywhere.
- **Tools/Resources** — what the server exposes. "Navigate to URL X", "read this file", "execute this query."

The client asks the server what it offers. The server responds with a list of tools. The AI picks a tool, sends parameters, the server executes, responds. Simple. Standardized. Universal.

There's an MCP server for practically everything today: GitHub, Linear, Notion, Postgres, browser via Playwright, filesystem, Slack. You plug in what you need. The AI then operates those tools as if they were native extensions of the client itself.

## Playwright as an MCP server: why it matters

Playwright is Microsoft's browser automation stack. Headless or not. Cross-browser (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit). Consistent API, performant, excellent DX. What Selenium always wanted to be and never managed.

When someone packages Playwright as an MCP server, the following happens: Claude gets **eyes in the browser**. Literally. It can:

- Open a page at a URL
- Take screenshots
- Read the DOM via accessibility snapshot
- Click an element
- Fill a form
- Wait for an element to appear
- Check the console for errors
- Inspect network requests
- Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the page context

All of this through commands the LLM picks based on context. You don't need to write a test spec. You describe in natural language — "validate that the post card opens correctly on mobile at 375px" — and Claude assembles the sequence: navigate, resize viewport, click, wait, screenshot, verify.

For those who haven't used it: it feels like magic. For those who have: it becomes a habit in 3 days.

> "But isn't this just another Playwright wrapper?" — no. A wrapper requires you to write code. MCP Playwright lets the AI choose the right step based on the task context. The difference isn't technical — it's abstraction. You move from "how" and stay at "what."

## Real flow: validating post UX before committing

To illustrate, here's the flow the Nextside team uses on this blog. Every time a new post comes out of the [revisor agent encoded via Claude Code superpowers](/en/posts/2026/05/16/claude-code-superpowers-plugin-na-pratica/) ready to commit, a dedicated **UX review** agent launches using MCP Playwright. Sequence:

- **Start Hugo locally** — `hugo server -D --port 1313`
- **Launch the agent** — describe the task: "validate post X in light/dark and at mobile 375px/desktop 1280px"
- **Claude navigates via MCP Playwright** — opens `localhost:1313/posts/.../{slug}/`, waits for load, takes screenshot
- **Inspect console** — checks for JS errors, font warnings, or broken image notices
- **Toggle dark mode** — clicks the theme toggle, waits for transition, takes screenshot
- **Resize to mobile** — resizes viewport to 375px, screenshot
- **Reports** — markdown with embedded screenshots + checklist (✓ contrast, ✓ typography, ⚠ long code overflows on mobile, ✓ ember glow only in CTA)

Total time: 30 to 90 seconds. Cost: zero extra infra. Output: a report I, as a human, read in 2 minutes and decide whether to commit or fix.

Compare with the old flow:
- Open manually in Chrome: 15s
- Open DevTools, simulate mobile: 20s
- Check dark mode: 10s
- Check console: 10s
- Forget to test at least one combination at least once a week: guaranteed

And here's the real gain. It's not speed — it's **consistency**. Claude doesn't forget to test dark mode. Doesn't skip mobile in a rush. Doesn't say "oh, I'll check the console later." Every time it runs, it runs everything.

**Automated discipline beats tired human discipline.**

## Before vs after: what changes in the dev flow

Look at the traditional flow. What we've always done:

1. Code the feature
2. Write unit tests
3. **Run the app locally and click through it** — navigate, click, validate visually
4. Open the PR
5. CI runs full Playwright + unit suite
6. Human reviewer looks at the code

Step 3 is where time evaporates. And it's the most skipped — "unit passed, ship to CI." Then a bug hits production that CI didn't catch because CI doesn't cover every possible path.

With MCP Playwright, step 3 becomes:

> 3\. **Ask Claude to test it:** "validate the checkout flow with a coupon on localhost:3000, give me screenshots of each step"

And Claude opens the browser via MCP, navigates, fills in, clicks, verifies, takes a screenshot of each state, reports console errors if any. You get back: "it worked. Evidence in `/tmp/checkout-*.png`." You attach the screenshots in the PR. **The human reviewer opens the PR with visual proof already in hand.** CI keeps running the full suite — that doesn't change. What changes is your manual test step before the PR.

### So this doesn't replace my E2E tests?

No. And it shouldn't. Your traditional E2E runs in CI without needing AI, works fine, validates regression deterministically. That's work the engineer writes once and runs a thousand times. MCP Playwright is different: it's your **local exploratory testing**, automated by AI, with visual proof. It's the step you used to do by clicking, now delegated.

## Concrete scenario: PO writes, AI validates

Look at how this turns into a real flow. Thursday morning, the PO writes a Gherkin scenario in Notion:

```gherkin
Feature: Checkout with discount coupon
  As a customer
  I want to apply a coupon at checkout
  So I can pay less for the order

  Scenario: Valid coupon applies discount
    Given I am on the checkout page
    And my cart has 2 items totaling R$ 200
    When I enter the coupon "NEXTSIDE10" in the discount field
    And I click "Apply"
    Then the total should drop to R$ 180
    And a message "Coupon applied: 10% off" should appear
    And the "Place order" button should remain enabled
```

The dev opens the terminal, and instead of running the app and clicking through each step herself to confirm the scenario passes (that manual pre-PR click-through everyone skips), she hands it to the AI:

```
Validate the Gherkin scenario below against the app running at http://localhost:3000.
Use MCP Playwright. Report each Then with ✅ or ❌ + a screenshot 
when something fails. Don't fix the code — just audit.

<paste the Gherkin here>
```

The AI with MCP Playwright:

1. Opens the browser at `http://localhost:3000/checkout`
2. Confirms it's on the checkout page (`networkidle` + `<h1>Checkout</h1>` visible)
3. Reads the DOM and confirms 2 items in the cart totaling R$ 200
4. Fills the "coupon" field with `NEXTSIDE10`
5. Clicks the "Apply" button
6. Waits for DOM change (`expect(total).toContain('180')`)
7. Checks visibility of the "Coupon applied: 10% off" message
8. Verifies the "Place order" button remains `enabled`

Reports back:

```
✅ Scenario: Valid coupon applies discount
  ✅ Given: on the checkout page (h1 visible, correct URL)
  ✅ And: 2 items, total R$ 200 (read from .cart-total)
  ✅ When: coupon NEXTSIDE10 applied
  ✅ Then: total updated to R$ 180
  ✅ And: success message visible
  ❌ And: "Place order" button is DISABLED

Final state screenshot: /tmp/checkout-disabled-btn.png
Suspicion: regression in coupon-success-handler that set disabled=true 
by mistake after applying the discount.
```

Total time: **35 seconds**. No E2E test written, no stub, no mock. **It validated against the real app, on your localhost, before the PR went to review.**

### But doesn't this replace real Playwright in CI/CD?

It doesn't. CI/CD keeps running the full suite on every PR. This flow is the **pre-flight**: before you open the PR, before CI spends 6min, before the human reviewer opens a tab to look, you already know whether the PO's scenario passes or fails. The regression above — button DISABLED by mistake — is exactly the kind of bug that hits production 2 sprints later because nobody tested that manual path.

The PO's Gherkin became executable input. **Acceptance documentation became running acceptance test.** Without anyone writing test code.

## What changes vs traditional E2E testing

Here's an important point so you don't get confused. MCP Playwright doesn't replace your E2E suite in CI. ABSOLUTELY NOT. They solve different things — and the confusion usually starts because the name "Playwright" shows up in both.

Traditional E2E is what the **engineer writes in code, versions in the repository, and CI runs automatically on every PR**. That doesn't change. That's still there.

MCP Playwright is **step 3 in the dev flow** — that manual click-through you used to do (or skip) before opening the PR. Except now the AI does it in your place.

Traditional E2E (Playwright spec running in CI):
- **Runs automatically on every PR** — blocks the merge if it fails
- **Specified in code** — explicit assertion, versioned, reviewed
- **Covers the full regression suite** — doesn't depend on you remembering
- **Slow** — minutes per execution, requires CI infra

MCP Playwright in Claude locally:
- **Runs when you ask** — blocks nothing by default
- **Specified in natural language** — flexible but not versioned
- **Covers what you describe in the moment** — depends on the instruction
- **Fast** — seconds per execution, zero infra

Ideal use case: **MCP Playwright is for the first validation layer, BEFORE you ask for human review.** It's the sanity check you'd do with your own hands, automated. It's not the CI safety net. It's the pre-flight check.

A real E2E suite is still needed for:
- Blocking regression on PR
- Critical coverage of payment flows, auth, etc.
- Executable documentation of expected behavior

MCP Playwright is needed for:
- Quick sanity check during development
- Visual validation of a feature under active change
- "Did I break anything?" before asking for review

They're complementary, not rivals. Whoever replaces their E2E suite with MCP Playwright will miss it the moment a big refactor happens and nothing breaks in CI but everything breaks in production.

## Limits and pitfalls

Hold on. There are pitfalls:

- **Not deterministic like code-based tests** — you describe "validate the card," Claude interprets. Two runs may check slightly different things. For sanity check: fine. For blocking regression: no.
- **Token cost** — each screenshot Claude consumes becomes input. In a long session, that adds up. Curate what you send it to inspect.
- **Silent failures** — if Claude didn't see something, it doesn't report it. False negative. You need to instruct it well on what to look for.
- **MCP server setup** — installing the local MCP server, configuring it in Claude Code, making sure the browser is available. The first time takes effort. After that, you forget it's there.
- **Local-only** — MCP Playwright in Claude Code runs on your machine. Not a solution for QA in a shared environment. For that, you still need traditional Playwright in CI.

And there's a culture pitfall: **devs get lazy writing real tests because "Claude tests for me."** That's a trap. MCP Playwright complements testing, it doesn't replace it. Whoever uses it as a substitute will learn the hard way — when a critical feature breaks in production with no test covering it.

> "But if MCP Playwright is so good, why do we need CI?" — because CI blocks what humans forget. MCP Playwright only runs when you ask. CI runs always. CI is the insurance, MCP is the pre-flight. Remove the insurance, and the first crash will remind you.

## What this says about the future of local QA

Here's what matters.

For a long time, local frontend validation was bad. You opened the browser, opened DevTools, remembered (or didn't) to test mobile, remembered (or didn't) to test dark mode, remembered (or didn't) to check the console. Every time. Manually. Getting tired.

Result: visual bug became production bug. Not because the dev is bad — because the human brain is not a reliable checklist machine after 4 hours of pair programming.

MCP Playwright changes that because it lets the **checklist become code** that another entity — the AI — runs for you. You never forget to test dark mode again. You never commit without seeing the console. Not because you got better — because the process now runs itself. It's the same logic we apply to [documenting technical decisions in ADRs in Notion](/en/posts/2026/05/16/adrs-decisao-no-notion-sem-burocracia/): take it out of human memory, put it in a format that survives fatigue.

That's what excites me most about MCP in general: it's the first time I see automation of tedious tasks with AI delivering REAL results, not promises. Playwright is just the most mature example. There will be MCP servers for everything you hate doing but have to do. And when you can evaluate new tech in 2 weeks instead of buying the whole idea, [Discovery is the right format](https://nextside.tech/#discovery) — you don't need to bet 6 months to know if MCP fits your pipeline.

And the team that adopts it first will gain consistency that the team that doesn't adopt will never be able to replicate through sheer willpower.

That's why the Nextside team runs MCP Playwright in every UX review agent. Not as an AI gimmick. As a **way of ensuring the boring checklist happens every time, without depending on me to remember at 11pm on a Friday.**

The AI gets tired less than you. Use that to your advantage.
